This project is tasked with creating the DireWolf Job Portal to help students find jobs. The DireWolf will help job seekers to look for jobs and employers to find suitable candidates for open positions.


The following are the Users of this Application:

Super Admin Username : admin@admin.com Password : admin

Admins Few admins defined in the system are: Username : nkatre@ncsu.edu Password : nkatre

Username : gshah@ncsu.edu Password : gshah

Employers Can be any person and can be created only by the admins However, few of the employers created for the application are: Username : employer@employer.com Password : employer

Job Seekers Can be any person and can be created using the sign-up option which appears while login However, few of the job seekers for the application are: Username : jobseeker@jobseeker.com Password : jobseeker

Active Buttons on the application:
1) HOME -> Redirects to the home-page
2) PROFILE -> This button will be inactive for users who are not logged in. But for the users who are logged in, it will show the corresponding "Profile" for the relevant type of user. Example: ADMIN, EMPLOYER, JOBSEEKER
3) SEARCH -> Search for the jobs on DireWolf. If the search bar is kept empty, it will search for all the jobs. If some string is entered, it will search for that string in the job database and show results relevant to that search.
4) LOGIN/LOGOUT -> Redirects to login page and logs out already logged in user.

List of things we plan to implement: E-mails are sent, to both the Employers and Job seekers Functionl Tests - Cucumber Testing UI improvements
